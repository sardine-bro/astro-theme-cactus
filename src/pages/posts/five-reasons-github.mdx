## Why Github Commits are not the best measurement of your skills as a developer

Scouting around TechTwitter these days you will most certainly find discourse related to those little green boxes from your Github commit history.
While I do enjoy having a good laugh at the memes related to this, it has got me thinking about all the times I am not on Github yet still doing developer related things.
Then I though how unfair it is to grade yourself as a developer based on this. It also made me reflect on how many tech recruiters glance at someones commit history on Github and determine that they will not hire the dev based on not having many green squares.
I for one think that is rather harsh. One main reason is that as a developer a lot of time I am either readin documentation, refreshing my skills by watching videos on whatever coding language I am wanting to strengthen. 
Then there are those who have a big gap in their commit history because they are working for a company and cannot openly discuss their commits. For example, I have a huge commit history gap on Github due to this reason.
Moreover, I am someone who prefers using Linux and opensource technology whenever possible and available for it to be used. Which is why I use something like [CodeBerg](https://codeberg.org/) for my version control in my personal projects. This however is a downside when only Github commit green squares are valuable for tech recruiters.
