As I begin wrapping up my final project for Flatiron School, I have begun to take a step back and reflect on all my experiences of attending an online coding boot camp during a global pandemic.

I’d like to start off by saying that my perception of time was heavily distorted by the pandemic. Weeks of being in lockdown have that effect on your brain. The one thing that stayed constant in my life was the labs, pod-meetings, and group discussions that were frequent occurrences during boot camp. I am honestly incredibly thankful for this consistency it allowed me to keep my ground and allowed me to have social interactions with people in my cohort as I couldn’t actually do that in person.

That being said, I can’t help but think about the really meaningful collaborations that would have occurred if I did not have to code with my cohort virtually. Throughout the entire process, I found myself coding isolated. This by no means has anything to do with Flatiron but it has to do with the nature of the pandemic and having to work Zoom and Slack calls with people living in different timezones. I really cannot help but think of how different my experience would have been if I was able to code in person with my cohort. I found that the perspective that others bring is incredibly helpful for problem-solving as people have completely different thought processes.

For those of you wanting to go through a coding boot camp, all I have to say is ‘my how time flies!’ That cannot be understated! I found myself consistently wondering where the days went as it would feel like I just submitted my last project and suddenly I have submitted a new project and beginning a new module.

This leads me to project week, project week is a strange dichotomy between excitement and utter nerve-wracking stress. I am the kind of person who always struggled to come up with ideas on what to build in my next project. A lot of project time for me was either spent procrastinating because I had no idea what I wanted to build or spent most of it catching up on labs because I fell behind due to my job interfering with my school.

Now that I have completed my projects and have begun to say goodbye to my cohorts and cohort leader (which shoutout to my cohort leader you were the best) I am left feeling like there is going to be something missing in my life. Earlier I mentioned that Flatiron provided me with consistency and social life, well now it feels like I am losing a part of that. While I am glad my cohorts were able to finish along with me it still feels like I am losing something meaningful in my life.

So if you ask me if I would be willing to do it all again? I would respond with an absolute yes! Sign me up!
Before I go, I would like to thank Flatiron for teaching me to be a developer. I learned so much and am thankful for that. While I am forlorn for my chapter at Flatiron coming to a close, I am excited to start working as software engineer (fingers crossed).
